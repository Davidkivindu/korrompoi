    <h2>MY PHILOSOPHY</h2>
      <p>
        “I believe in the healing power of truth, the dignity of every woman, and the restoration of identity 
        through self-awareness, mental wellness, and purpose.” </p>
        <strong>At the core of everything I do is advocacy</strong> — not just in words, but in action.
      
      <p>
        "Advocacy is the courageous act of using my voice, my story, and my experiences to defend the silent,
        uplift the broken, and challenge systems that silence truth.
      </p>
      <strong>It is standing in the gap where pain meets purpose</strong> — so that every girl, woman, or child who 
      once felt invisible can rise, be seen, and be heard."<br>
      <p><strong>Dr. Rachel Korrompoi</strong></p><br>
      <strong>This quote is not just a statement</strong> — it is a reflection of my life, my battles, and my daily 
      work with individuals and communities. Whether I’m mentoring a young girl, supporting a survivor of trauma, or 
      training a corporate team on wellness, I lead with compassion, clarity, and conviction. <br>
      
     <br> <p><strong>My guiding principles are:</strong></p>
      <strong>- Pain births purpose</strong> – We don’t bury our wounds; we turn them into wisdom.
      <br><strong>- Mental health is a right</strong> – Every woman, child, and community deserves peace of mind and 
      access to healing.
      <br><strong>- We rise together</strong> – Healing is a shared journey. Empowerment begins with connection.
      <br><strong>- Voice is power</strong> – Every story told shatters silence and sets someone free.
      <br><strong>- I do not walk alone</strong> — I walk with others, lighting the way where shadows once ruled.
    <h2>Advocacy</h2>

        <h2>Mental Health Tips for a Stronger, Balanced Life</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>1. Start Your Day with Intention</h3>
            Take 5–10 minutes every morning to breathe deeply, stretch, and set your intention for the day.
            A calm mind at sunrise helps carry peace into your day.
            <h3>2. Protect Your Energy</h3>
            Learn to say no to toxic conversations, overcommitting, or environments that drain you.
            Your peace is your power—guard it.
            <h3>3. Talk About It</h3>
            Don’t suffer in silence. Speak to a trusted friend, mentor, or mental health professional.
            Sharing lightens the load and opens doors to healing.
            <h3>4. Disconnect to Reconnect</h3>
            Take regular digital breaks. Step away from your phone, TV, or laptop to reconnect with yourself.
            Quiet time helps you hear your inner wisdom.
            <h3>5. Move Your Body</h3>
            Whether it's a walk, dance, or simple stretching—movement releases endorphins and reduces stress.
            Motion shifts emotion.
            <h3>6. Stay Hydrated and Nourished</h3>
            Food and water affect your brain chemistry. Choose balance over busyness. Eat to fuel your healing—not your hustle.
            <h3>7. Journal Your Thoughts</h3>
            Write down your feelings and experiences daily or weekly.
            Your journal is a mirror for your soul.
            <h3>8. Sleep is Sacred</h3>
            Prioritize rest. Your body and mind repair through quality sleep.
            Rest is not a reward—it’s a requirement.
            <h3>9. Celebrate Small Wins</h3>
            Acknowledge every step forward, even the tiniest ones.
            Progress, not perfection, is the goal.
            <h3>10. Seek Help Without Shame</h3>
            Therapy and coaching are tools of strength, not weakness.
            Asking for help is a brave act of self-love.
            <h3>11. Set and Respect Your Boundaries</h3>
            Know your limits—emotionally, mentally, physically, and spiritually. Say “no” without guilt and “yes” with
            intention. Boundaries are not walls—they are bridges to healthier relationships and inner peace.
            There is grace to saying No.

        <h2>Empowering You to Manage Your Finances with Clarity and Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          - Welcome to your safe space for building financial peace of mind. Whether you're a woman navigating
          daily expenses, a business owner seeking stability, or someone recovering from financial burnout—these
          tips are crafted for you. Here’s how to take control, step by step:
          <h3>1. Track Every Coin</h3>
          - What you don’t track, you can’t transform.
          Keep a simple notebook or app to record all your income and expenses. Awareness is the first step to
          financial healing.
          <h3>2. Create a Budget You Can Live With</h3>
           - A budget is not punishment—it’s empowerment. Break your money down into needs, wants, savings, and
           giving. Start with simple monthly goals.
           <h3>3. Save with a Purpose & a Community</h3>
           Join a chama or SACCO where saving becomes easier and more accountable. Saving with others builds
           discipline and hope.
      
           <h3>4. Set Real, Clear Goals</h3>
           Want to pay school fees? Buy land? Start a business? Write it down, give it a deadline, and save toward it little by little.
           <h3>5. Learn to Say “No” to Pressure</h3>
           Financial boundaries are self-care. You don’t have to attend every fundraiser or lend money you don’t have. Protect your peace.
           <h3>6. Avoid Unhealthy Debt</h3>
           Only borrow to grow—not to survive.
           If the loan doesn’t generate value (business income, education, assets), rethink it.
           <h3>7. Delay the Gratification</h3> You don’t need to buy it now.
           Waiting 24–48 hours before a purchase helps you spend intentionally, not emotionally.
           <h3>8. Change Your Money Mindset</h3>
           You are not poor—you’re preparing. Speak life into your finances. Don’t say “I’m broke.” Say “I’m building.”
            <h3>9. Teach Your Children Early</h3>
            Start with small chores, rewards, and savings jars. Money habits begin at home. Raise financially wise children.
          <h3>10. Ask for Help Without Shame</h3>
          You’re not alone. Talk to a coach, elder, or group you trust. There’s no shame in financial struggle—only strength in learning and rising again.
          <h3>11. Create Multiple Streams of Income</h3>
          Relying on one income source is risky—especially in uncertain times.
          Start small: turn your skills, hobbies, or experience into side income. Whether it's farming, baking, selling online, or teaching, every extra stream brings freedom.
          When one source slows down, the others sustain you. Financial peace is built on diversity.
          <h3>12. Learn a Skill or Trade</h3>
          When you have a skill, you always have a way forward.
          Whether it’s tailoring, digital marketing, baking, hairdressing, farming, or public speaking—skills
          open doors to opportunity, dignity, and income.
      
          <h3>Don’t wait for a job—equip yourself to create your own.</h3>
